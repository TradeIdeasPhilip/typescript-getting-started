        I made this with SVG and the JavaScript animation API. You can do this
        yourself, but not until you set up your tools. This document will show
        you how to install modern JavaScript programming tools. You're just a
        few minutes away from writing and running your own code.

      <h2>Script Test</h2>
      <div id="testResult">üòû üòí üò´ üòñ</div>
      <p>
        Hello world, my name is
        <span
          class="highlight"
          id="insertNameHere"
          data-comment="Using TypeScript‚Äº"

      <h1>Purpose & Background</h1>
      <p>
        The JavaScript ecosystem has become so complicated. Even if you know the
        basic language, it is hard to use unless you understand the common tools
        and libraries.
      </p>
      <p>
        This document will get you set up with a
        <span class="highlight">minimum</span> reasonable set of tools. And it
        will set you up with a template for a
        <span class="highlight">minimum</span> project. This is a perfect
        starting place for a new projects. And if you need to install more tools
        and libraries, you'll be all ready for that.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are viable alternatives to most of these tools. However, I
        recommend you start here before you explore on your own.
      </p>
      <h1>My Tools</h1>
      <p>Install these once per computer.</p>
      <h2>VS Code</h2>
      <p>
        There are a lot of useful extensions and such that work with VS Code.
        It's the only editor I use for web stuff.
      </p>

          <code>autofetch</code> and set it to true.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>git</h2>
      <p>
        You do not need to be an expert in
        <a href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a>, but you will need the
        <code>git</code> command line tools to follow these and other
        directions.
      </p>
      <h3>Install</h3>
      <p>
        On my Mac I started from the terminal and typed <code>git</code>. I
        clicked OK a few times and eventually an installer came up and did its
        job.
      </p>
      <h3>Configure</h3>
      <p>
        Type the next couple of lines at the terminal. Use your own name and
        email. These will be recorded as part of every commit.
      </p>
      <div>
        <code
          >git config --global user.name "<span class="redacted">John Doe</span
          >"</code
        >
      </div>
      <div>
        <code
          >git config --global user.email <span class="redacted">johndoe</span
          ><span class="default-font">@</span
          ><span class="redacted">example</span>.<span class="redacted"
            >com</span
          ></code
        >
      </div>
      <p>
        The following is not strictly required, but I like to type
        <code>git plog</code>. <span style="font-family: Peralta">‚Äú</span>P<span
          style="font-family: Peralta"
          >‚Äù</span
        >
        is for <span style="font-family: Peralta">‚Äú</span>Philip<span
          style="font-family: Peralta"
          >‚Äù</span
        >.
      </p>
      <div>
        <code
          >git config --global alias.plog 'log --graph --oneline --all
          --decorate'</code
        >
      </div>

      <h2>npm & Node</h2>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npm</a> is the hub for JavaScript
        libraries and tools. Initially I tried to avoid it because it was so big
        and complicated, but <code>npm</code> is
        <span class="highlight">essential</span>. Some tools and libraries are
        available multiple ways, but I always recommend using
        <code>npm</code> if you get the choice.
      </p>
      <p>
        <code>npm</code> stands for Node
        <span class="highlight">Package</span> Manager. The program you're about
        to write is a <span class="highlight">package</span>. Each library you
        want to use is a <span class="highlight">package</span>. A lot of your
        development tools are <span class="highlight">packages</span>.
        <code>npm</code> is a repository for
        <span class="highlight">packages</span> and a tool for downloading,
        installing, building, testing and otherwise manipulating
        <span class="highlight">packages</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <code>npm</code> works well with <code>git</code> and a lot of other
        relevant tools. I use <code>npm</code> as part of my normal build and
        test processes.
      </p>
      <h3>Install</h3>
      <p>
        This process changes frequently. Currently the internet says to follow
        the directions on <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node's homepage</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the past I've used
        <a href="https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating">NVM</a>
        and other tools to install <code>npm</code> and Node. The process used
        to be complicated and bug-ridden. It looks like the standard installer
        works better now.
      </p>
      <h2>TypeScript</h2>
      <p>
        If you don't know TypeScript, learn it. It gives you all of the nice
        safety features of C++/Java/C#, but without breaking any of the nice
        parts of JavaScript. I never use plain JavaScript if I can help it.
      </p>
      <h3>Install</h3>
      <p>
        Open a terminal window. Make sure you are not inside an
        <code>npm</code> project. (Otherwise you will eventually get the
        <span style="font-family: Peralta">‚Äú</span>This is not the tsc command
        you are looking for<span style="font-family: Peralta">‚Äù</span> error
        with the oversized red background.) Type
        <code>npm install -g typescript</code>.
      </p>

      <h2>GitHub</h2>
      <p>
        You don't need a GitHub account to use these tools. But if you have a
        GitHub account and you are installing dev tools on a new computer you
        probably want to do this. This lets tools on your computer access your
        GitHub account without asking for your password each time.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the terminal type <code>ssh-keygen</code> and take all the defaults.
        This will create a new pair of cryptographic keys.
      </p>
      <p>
        Type <code>cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</code> to display your new public key.
      </p>
      <p>
        Go to
        <a href="https://github.com/settings/keys"
          >https://github.com/settings/keys</a
        >
        and add your new public key.
      </p>

      <h2>Vite</h2>
      <p>
        I always use <a href="https://vitejs.dev/">Vite</a> to manage my
        projects. Vite takes care of <span class="highlight">a lot</span> of
        <span class="highlight">annoying</span> details related to using 3rd
        party libraries and to testing and releasing your code.
      </p>
      <h3>Install</h3>
      <p>
        You do <span class="highlight">not</span> need to install this on your
        computer. You will automatically get these tools when you start a new
        project through any of the methods described below.
        <code>npm</code> takes care of installing and upgrading this tool.
      </p>
      <h3>Use</h3>
      <p>
        <code>cd</code> into your project directory. That's the default if you
        are using the terminal build into VS Code.
      </p>
      <p>
        Type <code>npm run dev</code> to start a test server. (Sometimes VS Code
        will do this for you automatically.) This will display instructions and
        status on the standard output. Any time you modify a file, the dev
        server will automatically rebuild (if required) and push the changes to
        the browser.
      </p>
      <p>
        By default the development web server only handles local requests. But
        that's easy to change so you can test on your phone's browser.
      </p>
      <p>
        Type <code>npm run build</code> to pack your code up for a normal web
        server. My template, below, is configured to work with
        <a
          href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site"
          >GitHub's free hosting</a
        >.
      </p>
      <h2>degit</h2>
      <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit ">degit</a> is a tool for
        creating a new project from a template. Typically the template and the
        new project are both stored in GitHub repositories.
      </p>
      <h3>Install</h3>
      Type <code>npm install -g degit</code> at the command line.
      <h1>Try It!</h1>
      <p>Here are several ways to create a project.</p>
      <h2>git clone</h2>
      <p>
        Use this method to start from an existing project. For example type
        <code
          >git clone
          https://github.com/TradeIdeasPhilip/typescript-getting-started</code
        >
        to copy the source for this document to your computer. This will create
        a directory called <code>typescript-getting-started</code> in the
        current directory on your local machine. Start VS Code and open that
        directory to start work.
      </p>
      <h3>Assignment #1</h3>
      <p>Clone this project.</p>
      <p>
        At the top, where it says <span style="font-family: Peralta">‚Äú</span>my
        name is,<span style="font-family: Peralta">‚Äù</span>
        fill in your own name. Do it using TypeScript, not HTML. Keep the
        <span class="highlight">highlight</span>
        formatting.
      </p>
      <p>
        And remove all that round Earth propaganda from the title. Replace it
        with something more appropriate like ùî±ùî∞ or ùïãùï§ or ùíØùíÆ or ùëáùëÜ.
      </p>
      <p>View your changes in development mode.</p>
      <h2>degit template</h2>
      <p style="color: darkorange">
        Coming soon! This is the ideal way to start a new project. Or it will
        be.
      </p>
      <p>
        Type
        <code
          >degit https://github.com/TradeIdeasPhilip/typescript-template
          <i>new-project-name</i></code
        >. This will create a new directory called <i>new-project-name</i> in
        the current directory with the contents of the template. Open this
        directory in VS Code and start creating.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some people use the word
        <span style="font-family: Peralta">‚Äú</span>scaffolding,<span
          style="font-family: Peralta"
          >‚Äù</span

      <h3>Assignment #2</h3>
      <p>
        Start a new project from this template. Add a small amount of custom
        HTML, CSS, and TypeScript. Build the project and publish it to GitHub
        pages.
      </p>
      <h2>npm create vite@latest</h2>
      <p>
        You can create a new project using Vite by typing
        <code>npm create vite@latest</code>. This will use a template provided
        by Vite. This will include instructions and examples to help you learn
        Vite.
      </p>
      <h3>Assignment #3</h3>
      <p>Explore Vite.</p>

        the tools I've described here, and serves as an example of my process.
      </p>
      <h2>Source Materials</h2>
      <p>
        I started from

        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        I added degit. I removed the git sub module stuff. And I updated some
        other sections.

      <h2>Fonts</h2>
      <p style="font-family: 'Peralta'">
        <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Peralta">Peralta</a> is
