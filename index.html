        I made this with SVG and the JavaScript animation API. You will learn to
        do this, but not yet. This document will show you how to install modern
        JavaScript programming tools. You're just a few minutes away from
        writing and running your own code.

      <h2>Script Test</h2>
      <div id="testResult">üòû üòí üò´ üòñ</div>
      <p>
        Hello world, my name is
        <span
          class="highlight"
          id="insertNameHere"
          data-comment="Using TypeScript‚Äº"
          >¬´See assignment #1 for details.¬ª</span
        >!
      </p>
      <h1>Purpose & Background</h1>
      <p>
        The JavaScript ecosystem has become so complicated. Even if you know the
        basic language, it is hard to use unless you understand the common tools
        and libraries.
      </p>
      <p>
        This document will get you set up with a
        <span class="highlight">minimum</span> reasonable set of tools. And it
        will set you up with a template for a
        <span class="highlight">minimum</span> project. This is a perfect
        starting place for a new projects. And if you need to install more tools
        and libraries, you'll be all ready for that.
      </p>
      <h1>Tools</h1>
      <p>Install these once per computer.</p>
      <p>
        Some of these instructions look oddly specific because I've added small
        notes where I've gotten stuck before.
      </p>
      <h2>VS Code</h2>
      <p>
        There are a lot of useful extensions and such that work with VS Code.
        It's the only editor I use for web stuff.
      </p>
      <h3>Install and Configure</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Download from
          <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">here</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Install the following extensions:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <a
                href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker"
                >Code Spell Checker</a
              >
            </li>

                >JavaScript and TypeScript Nightly</a
              >
            </li>
            <li>
              <a
                href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=antfu.vite"
                >Vite</a
              >
              (The Anthony Fu version.)
            </li>
            <li>
              <a
                href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode"
                >Prettier</a
              >
              (Any time VS Code asks me which formatter to use, I pick the one
              with ‚ùùprettier‚ùû in the name.)
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Main menu > Code > Preferences > Settings. Search for git
          <code>autofetch</code> and set it to true.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>git</h2>
      <p>
        You do not need to be an expert in
        <a href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a>, but you will need the
        <code>git</code> command line tools to follow these and other
        directions.
      </p>
      <h3>Install</h3>
      <p>
        On my Mac I started from the terminal and typed <code>git</code>. I
        clicked OK a few times and eventually an installer came up and did its
        job.
      </p>
      <h3>Configure</h3>
      <p>
        Type the next couple of lines at the terminal. Use your own name and
        email. These will be recorded as part of every commit.
      </p>
      <div>
        <code
          >git config --global user.name "<span class="redacted">John Doe</span
          >"</code
        >
      </div>
      <div>
        <code
          >git config --global user.email
          <span class="redacted">johndoe</span>@<span class="redacted"
            >example</span
          >.<span class="redacted">com</span></code
        >
      </div>
      <p>
        The following is not strictly required, but I like to type
        <code>git plog</code>. ‚ùùP‚ùû is for ‚ùùPhilip‚ùû.
      </p>
      <div>
        <code
          >git config --global alias.plog 'log --graph --oneline --all
          --decorate'</code
        >
      </div>

      <h2>npm and Node</h2>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npm</a> is the hub for JavaScript
        libraries and tools. Initially I tried to avoid it because it was so big
        and complicated, but <code>npm</code> is
        <span class="highlight">essential</span>. Some tools and libraries are
        available multiple ways, but I always recommend using
        <code>npm</code> if you get the choice.
      </p>
      <p>
        <code>npm</code> stands for Node
        <span class="highlight">Package</span> Manager. The program you're about
        to write is a <span class="highlight">package</span>. Each library you
        want to use is a <span class="highlight">package</span>. A lot of your
        development tools are <span class="highlight">packages</span>.
        <code>npm</code> is a repository for
        <span class="highlight">packages</span> and a tool for downloading,
        installing, building, testing and otherwise manipulating
        <span class="highlight">packages</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <code>npm</code> works well with <code>git</code> and a lot of other
        relevant tools. I use <code>npm</code> as part of my normal build and
        test processes.
      </p>
      <h3>Install</h3>
      <p>
        This process changes frequently. Check Google for more recent
        information.
      </p>
      <p>
        I used
        <a href="https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating">NVM</a>
        to install <code>npm</code> and Node. I started with the instructions on
        the NVM website then I fixed a few things. This is what I did last time:
      </p>
      <p>
        At the terminal type <code>cd ; touch .zshrc .profile</code>. The
        install program should add things to both of these scripts. If you try
        to do a build and it can't find a command, check these scripts.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the terminal type
        <code
          >curl -o-
          https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh |
          bash</code
        >
        to install NVM.
      </p>
      <p>
        Close that terminal window and start a new one. Type
        <code>nvm install node</code> to install Node and npm.
      </p>
      <h2>TypeScript</h2>
      <p>
        If you don't know TypeScript, learn it. It gives you all of the nice
        safety features of C++/Java/C#, but without breaking any of the nice
        parts of JavaScript. I never use plain JavaScript if I can help it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Open a terminal window. Make sure you are not inside an
        <code>npm</code> project. (Otherwise you will eventually get the ‚ùùThis
        is not the tsc command you are looking for‚ùû error with the oversized red
        background.) Type <code>npm install -g typescript</code>.
      </p>

      <h2>GitHub</h2>
      <p>
        You don't need a GitHub account to use these tools. But if you have a
        GitHub account and you are installing dev tools on a new computer you
        probably want to do this. This lets tools on your computer access your
        GitHub account without asking for your password each time.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the terminal type <code>ssh-keygen</code> and take all the defaults.
        This will create a new pair of cryptographic keys.
      </p>
      <p>
        Type <code>cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</code> to display your new public key.
      </p>
      <p>
        Go to
        <a href="https://github.com/settings/keys"
          >https://github.com/settings/keys</a
        >
        and add your new public key.
      </p>
